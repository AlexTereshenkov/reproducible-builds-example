## Overview

This is an example project that demonstrates the concept of reproducible builds 
with a few C++ source files and CMake build steps.

The source code is based on a Conan blog article: 
[An introduction to deterministic builds with C/C++](https://blog.conan.io/2019/09/02/Deterministic-builds-with-C-C++.html).
The source code is served to help you get started as some of the code snippets in that blog
post are incomplete and require minor modification.

Depending on the platform and the compiler used, you may get slightly different results.

## `Release` directory

Contains example files for the section "Timestamps introduced by the compiler/linker".

## `Debug` directory

Contains example files for the section "Build folder information propagated to binaries".
